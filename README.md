## REPOS

For this project I tried to focus mainly on architecture with MVVM so it can be expanded later

Things I would have done with more time:
-Add tests to SearchViewModel - I started on this, but ran into an error with the coroutine scope
inside initialization method
-Add tests for Composables
-Add a way to manually refresh results, in case network connection is restored.

## Build tools & versions used

Built with Android Studio Electric Eel | 2022.1.1 Patch 2

## Steps to run the app

Run on Android Studio or ./gradlew installDebug
